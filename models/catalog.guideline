  <rules id="G1.01" name="Missing Authentication" description="This refers to the absence of an authentication mechanism in the system. Apart from external entities, like users or other systems the system may interact with, authentication may be necessary within the system between processes/components/datastores that are located in different trust boundaries.">

  <rules id="G1.02" name="Authentication Bypass using an alternate path" description="This refers to the case where although there is an authentication mechanism in place, it does not cover all possible entry points to the system. This can be due to the fact that there is a remote access point to the system aiming towards support or maintenance, a possible backdoor. Additionally, a system may make a call to invoke functionality of an external application. In such case, the external application can have access to resources and data of the system if not contained properly.">

  <rules id="G1.03" name="Relying on Single Factor Authentication" description="Although single factor authentication schemes, like password, can be effcient and suffcient for many systems, using a multifactor authentication scheme is recommended if the system handles sensitive data or operations, like bank transactions. Even if a strong password management policy is in place, this can be obtained by malicious parties in several ways. For example, many users are used to typing their password whenever they are prompted, so they might accidentally input their password in a form induced by the attacker. Additionally, if the authentication is based on shared resources, like IP address or MAC, these can be easily spoofed or altered leaving the system vulnerable. Such resources can be effective if they are used as part of an authentication scheme, but not as the sole factor for authentication.">

  <rules id="G1.04" name="Insufficient Session Management" description="Not managing a session properly throughout its lifecycle can leave the system vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. Session management involves creation (the session should be established through a secure channel and session identifier should be encrypted), the time frame the session is active (an attacker might attempt to reuse the session ID to gain access) and its destruction/invalidation (proper session invalidation should take place when the user logs out or session timeout. Not terminating sessions can also lead to resource depletion)."/>
  <rules id="G1.06" name="Insufficient Cryptograhic Key Management" description="This refers to the generation, distribution and storage of the cryptographic keys in the system. A compromise of a key means that every piece of information encrypted with this key is compromised. If there is no mechanism to replace a key or any auditing to aid in recovering, this can lead to serious compromise of the system.">
